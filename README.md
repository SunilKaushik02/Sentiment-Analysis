# Sentiment-Analysis
## Objective: Web crawler to scrape e-commerce site to analyze review of a dog product.

Recently, on March 3, 2021 there was a class action suit followed by news in the US that **Seresto**, a dog/cat collar, 
to prevent fleas and ticks had started developing allergies on the users of the collar. This event led US Parliamentary Committee
to ask Elanco to voluntarily withdraw the product from the market. 

This product is governed by EPA and FDA of the US.

I was curious to know if there was any negative sentiment surrounding the news and after few days how is the sentiment i.e. is it still strong 
or has it died down.

**Results:**
1. There was an immediate impact on sentiment once the news was published. 
2. The negative sentiment slowly died down after the news, possibly because of numerous confident public statements from Elanco, concentration on other 
topics for media to cover like COVID.
